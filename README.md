# Hotstone
Hearthstone clone built in Java.  
The project focused on creating testdriven (TDD) software and using software strategies and design patterns. 


The game was developed with my buddy Eske Junker at Aarhus University in the course Software Development and architecture.
We used Gradle to automate the building, testing, and deployment of the project.
